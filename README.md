Project with hotel reservations

It is my first large-scale project. It consists of two sites, an administrative site and a client site. There is an implemented back-end part (api) for the interaction of sites with the mongoDb database. A large number of libraries were used, you can check the full list of libraries under the section “Used technologies”. Sites are responsive and look great on any screen size.

- Information about the admin site
When entering the site, you need to log in. There is no possibility of registration. It is possible to manage users, hotel types, hotels and reservations (CRUD). Users are divided into 3 types - administrators, hotel owners and guests. (owners and guests can log in only on the client site).

- Information about the client site
When entering the site, we get to the home page. It has a search field which can be used to find the hotel we need by name or location. There is a list of hot deals and a list of hotel types. Users who are not logged in can use the site, but they have limited access. It is possible to register both as a hotel owner or a guest. Both types of users can update their credentials. Guests have the opportunity to make hotel reservations. And the owners can add and manage hotels. The hotel created by the owner, will become available on the client side only after the administrator confirms it.

This is just a short summary of the project. In case you will require additional information, you can reach me at “pavlo.khashchevskyi.dev@gmail.com”
